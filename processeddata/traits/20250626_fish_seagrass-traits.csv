They are usually in schools over sand or mud bottom (Ref. 2850), between 0 and 10 m, occurring equally in tropical, subtropical and temperate waters (Project MUGIL).  They are mainly diurnal, feeding on detritus, micro-algae and benthic organisms (Ref. 56548, 74902, 74760).  Juveniles feed on zooplankton until about 3.0 cm SL (Ref. 59043).  Reproduction takes place at sea, at various times of the year depending on the location (Ref. 74907, Amour).  Adults form schools and migrate offshore to spawn and developing larvae migrate back inshore (Ref. 81659). There is absence of an obligatory freshwater phase in the life cycle (Ref. 74752).   Females spawn 0.8 to 2.6 million eggs which develop at sea (Ref. 74912, Chen & Su 1986).  Sexually mature at 3 to 4 years (Ref. 74902).

In some areas such as Shark Bay and the Houtman Abrolhos in Western Australia, adults live in marine waters throughout the year.  This behaviour seems to occur only where estuarine and freshwater habitats are limited (Ref. 28722).  A small proportion (probably about 5%) (Ref. 28722) of older juveniles may leave the estuaries and migrate along the beaches in early summer.  The migration may be associated with flooding of rivers and is referred to as the 'hardgut' migration because the mullets' guts are empty (Ref. 28722).  Migrating sea mullet do not feed during either the 'hardgut' migration or spawning migration (Ref. 6390).  Feed on zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, microalgae, and detritus (Ref. 11889).  Undergo ontogenic shift in diet (Ref. 41769).  Small mullet (< 4 cm SL) feed exclusively on sediment by browsing.  Large mullet (< 4 cm SL) have been observed to feed by grazing on the sediment (Ref. 41769).  Changes in the feeding habits from planktonic organisms and migratory zooplankton to meiobenthos which takes place between 0.1 and 0.2 cm length, and a switch from meiobenthos to microbenthos between 0.15 and 0.25 cm length (Ref. 56101).  Sea mullet normally feed close to the river bed in shallow water, but do move throughout the water column in river channels and individuals often jump high out of the water (Ref. 6390).  Sea mullet have a strong tendency to school as juveniles and during the spawning season as adults.  Feeding schools of juveniles commonly disperse over sand and mud flats of estuaries during high tide and reform on the ebb tide (Ref. 28722).  Presence of sharp pointed teeth  that enable the species to select fine material (Ref. 74863).
In southwestern Australia, <i>Mugil cephalus</i> is a dominant finfish in the middle and upper estuaries especially in winter and spring - up to 95% of frequency of occurrence (Lonengan & Potter 1990).  Has a short, well-defined juvenile recruitment period; although found in freshwater, occurs in far greater numbers in all areas of estuaries and is common in the sea (Ref. 74748, 74749).  Gill-raker filaments were found in the stomach captured using gill net.  Mullets struggle to be free of the constricting meshes, food is often regurgitated at an early stage, subsequent gasping of oxygen would then easily cause gill-rakers, broken loose in the struggle, to be swalowed (Ref. 74739).

Occurs in lakes and rocky runs and pools of small to large rivers (Ref. 86798).  Some landlocked populations exist. Found in all rivers where temperature rises above 10° C for about 3 months per year and does not exceed 20° C for more than a few weeks in summer (Ref. 59043) (preferred temperatures 4-12°C). Juveniles may live in cold lakes in northern Europe (Ref. 59043). Parr (i.e. juveniles) are territorial and are found in the upper reaches of rivers and streams, in riffle areas with strong current and rough gravel bottoms (Ref. 7471). During winter, parr seek refuge in small spaces or under stones during the day (Refs. 59043, 89461). Young remain in freshwater for 1 to 6 years, then migrate to coastal marine waters or even to open oceans where they remain for 1 to 4 years before returning to freshwater  for spawning (Ref. 51442). Adults inhabit cooler waters with strong to moderate flow (Ref. 44894). The Atlantic salmon is reported to live up to 10 years, but most individuals only reach 4-6 years (Ref. 88187). Juveniles feed mainly on aquatic insects, mollusks, crustaceans and fish; adults at sea feed on squids, shrimps, and fish (Ref. 51442). Most populations depend mostly or exclusively on stocking due to degradations of environmental conditions.  Fishing pressure on wild stocks has decreased due to intensive farming but other problems have increased. Farmed salmons escape in large numbers and move to any river and hybridize with wild stocks (Ref. 59043). This species may hybridize with trout (Salmo trutta) (Ref. 59043). Diseases of the species include furunculosis (Aeromonas salmonicida), corynebacterial kidney disease (Renibacterium salmoninarum), enteric red mouth disease (Yersinia ruckeri), infectious pancreatic necrosis virus, bacterial kidney disease, fin rot and fungus infections (Ref. 5951).

Albacore tend to concentrate along thermal discontinuities such as the Transition Zone in the north Pacific and the Kuroshio Front east of Japan because of richer forage organisms but poorer in oxygen content. Albacore migrate within water masses rather than across temperature and oxygen boundaries. Minimum oxygen requirements are probably about 2 ml/l. At least two stocks (northern and southern) are believed to exist in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. Feed during the day and at night (diurnal and nocturnal).
The migration pattern of albacore in the south Pacific Ocean has recently been described (Ref. 30272). Juveniles move from the tropics into temperate waters and then eastwards along the subtropical convergence zone. At maturity, albacore return to the tropics but go back to temperate waters after spawning (Ref. 6390).
In Australian waters, larvae are present on the North West shelf all summer, but are present off north-eastern Australia mainly between October and December (Ref. 30274). Juveniles are found off New South Wales from September to November, and during summer they follow the warmer waters of the East Australian Current southwards (Ref. 6390). Albacore may reach eastern Tasmanian waters by December, where they remain until about April (Ref. 6390). As autumn approaches and warm waters recede, the juveniles move northwards and are present again off New South Wales until May (Ref. 30278).

There are two forms, the anadromous form known as the sockeye and the landlocked form (with a much smaller maximum size) known as the kokanee (Ref. 27547).  Upon emergence from gravel, fry at first tends to avoid light, hiding during the day and emerging at night (Ref. 27547).  In some populations, sockeye fry go to the sea during their first summer but most spend one or two (rarely three or four) years in a lake before migrating (Ref. 30333).  In a few streams of the Copper River drainage in Alaska, young sockeye stay in the stream (Ref. 27547).  Once in the lake, the young spend a few weeks inshore, feeding largely on ostracods, cladocerans and insect larvae.  The fish then become pelagic and move offshore, where they feed on plankton in the upper 20 m or so (Ref. 27547).  Seaward migration follows with the young individuals first staying fairly close to shore, feeding mainly on zooplankton, but also on small fishes and insects (Ref. 30343, 30346).  With growth, they head out to sea and fish become important in the diet (Ref. 27547).  Kokanee are confined to lake-stream systems, and most of its life is spent in the lake (Ref. 27547).  They feed mainly on plankton, but also take insects and bottom organisms (Ref. 1998).  Kokanee, wherever they are native, have been derived from anadromous populations, and each kokanee population apparently has evolved independently from a particular sockeye run (Ref. 30338, 30339).  Offspring of kokanee occasionally become anadromous, and sockeye offspring occasionally remain in freshwater (Ref. 27547).  Lifespan of the kokanee varies from two to seven years in different stocks (Ref. 27547).  The sockeye is one of the most commercially important Pacific salmons; the kokanee is primarily a sport fish but also makes excellent food and in some areas well regarded as food for large trout (Ref. 27547).

Bigeye tuna are more tolerant of lower temperatures and lower dissolved oxygen concentration than are other tunas and tend to occupy deeper waters (Ref. 30326).  For example, during the day, adult bigeye tuna inhabit the thermocline zone at about 150-250 m in tropical waters where temperatures descend to almost 10°C, provided dissolved oxygen concentration is more than 1 mg per l (Ref. 28952, 30327).

Young bigeye tuna have not been reported outside tropical waters (Ref. 30326).  In Australia, bigeye tuna smaller than 20 kg may form surface-dwelling schools of similar sized fish with other species such as yellowfin tuna and skipjack tuna (<i>Katsuwonus pelamis</i>).
